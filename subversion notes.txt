Subversion

Usually it will install the binaries under /usr/bin

Need to have /usr/bin/svnserve -d in order to process requests

Each repo has a svnserve.conf under /repo/conf
This files controls the configuration of the svnserve daemon
for this specific repository, these are some common enabled options:

anon-access = read
auth-access = write
password-sb = passwd   (this points to the location of the passwd file)
			it can also be password-sb = /svn/passwd


Also under /repo/conf there is a file that stores the passwords
for the allowed users, the file is called passwd
Entries should look like this:
svntest = test
pbuenrostro = test
