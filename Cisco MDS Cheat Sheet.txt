**********

***Default Roles***
Network-operator, network-admin and default-role


***AAA - HOW TO*** Stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting which are services that are provided locally or by a Radius or TACACS+ protocol
Radius how to config:
aaa group server radius RADIUS_GROUP	- Create a Radius group
server 1.1.1.1
radius-server host 1.1.1.1 key <key1>
aaa authentication login default group RADIUS_GROUP local - Changes the default authentication for telnet and ssh sessions to Radius than local if the radius doesn't work

sh aaa auth		shows the authentication enabled methods for default(telnet,ssh), console, iscsi and dhchap(devices when connect to the swtich)
sh aaa accounting	show the accounting enabled methods(log data for each session on the switch)
sh radius-server		display radius servers
sh radius status		Displays the status of radius distribution, sessions, etc

For role mapping from the Radius server:
Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles="rolename1 rolename2"
For role mapping from TACACS+:
roles="rolename1 rolename2


Other:
aaa auth login console group radius_group local		- Optional for authentication methods for the console
aaa auth iscsi default group radius_group local		- For iSCSI
aaa auth dhchap default group radius_group local	- For authentication devices that connect to the switch
aaa auth login default none				- FOR NO AUTHENTICATION!!!!!!! on telnet and ssh, can use "console" and "mschap" rather then "default"
aaa accounting group radius_group local			- Send accounting info to the radius group than local if not available
Even if local is not specified as one of the options is tried when all other options fail

Radius global options:
timeout, wait time for response from a radius server
retransmit, retries default is one
idle-time, amount of time before the switch sends out a test packet to the Radius server
deadtime, amount of time before the swtich declares dead the radius server
directed-request, allows users to selec a radius server for auth

Notes:
Radius default auth port 1812
Radius default accounting port 1813
*Cisco ACS Server is regularly used to provide AAA services, also can use Windows IAS which has Radius capabilities
***

sh logging nvram last 15 - log messages with a severity level of critical and below(0,1 and 2) are saved in NVRAM
sh logging level	-  Default logging severity for all services, 0=emerg, 1=alerts, 2=critical, 3=errors, 4=warnings...
sh logging logfile	- equal to more /var/adm/messages, looks at the entire log from begining
sh logging server	- logging server

*******************************************


***RSCN*** Registered State Change Notification***
A FC service that informs hosts about changes in the fabric like disk join or leaving, FCNS registration change, new zone
enforcement, IP address change or any other event that affects operation of the host.
Once the switch sends an RSCN it's up to the nodes to query the FCNS to obtain new information.
Changes are not delivered by the switch in the RSCN sent to the nodes.
Apart from sending a RSCN to all registered hosts a switch RSCN(SW-RSCN) is sent to all reacheables switches in the fabric.

sh rscn scr-table vsan 2
sh rscn stat vsan 2

If RSCN muti-pid option is enabled, then RSCN's may contain more thatn one affected port ID's.
You can enabled it with config t, rscn muti-pid vsan 2
***

***Zoneset izolation due to zone merge failure***TO BE REVIEWED
When two switches in a fabric are merged using a TE or E port, the port may become isolated if:
   1) The Two switches have zones at either side with identical names
   2) The active zone set on both switches contain a zone with the same name but with different zone members
To verify this information, do this on both switches:
   1) sh zone vsan vsan-id
   2) sh zoneset vsan vsan-id
To fix you need to overwrite the zoning config of one switch with the other switch's config with either of the following commands:
   1) zoneset import interface fc1/1 vsan 5	(This will overwrite the local switch active zoneset with that of the remote switch)
   2) zoneset export interface fc1/1 vsan 5	(Overwrite's the remote swtich active zone set with local switch config)
***


***Full Zone Set Distribution across the fabric***
You can distribute full zone sets using one of two methods:
1) one-time distribution at the EXEC mode level
2) full zone set distribution at the configuration mode level. 

				zoneset distribution Command Differences:
zoneset distribute vsan Command(EXEC Mode)    				 zoneset distribute full vsan Command(Configuration Mode)

1)Distributes the full zone set immediately.      			1)Does not distribute the full zone set immediately.

2)Does not distribute the full zone set information
along with the active zone set during activation,
deactivation, or merge process.						2)Remembers to distribute the full zone set information along with the active zone set during
							                activation, deactivation and merge processes.
***

***All switches in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family distribute active zone sets when new E port links come up or when a new zone set is activated in a VSAN***
***The active zone set is not part of the full zone set***
***Each VSAN has a full database and an active database***
**Fcaliases can be created from pwwn, fwwn, fcid's, etc***
***Each end device (N port or NL port) discovers other devices in the fabric by querying the name server. When a device logs in to the name server, the name
   server returns the list of other devices that can be accessed by the querying device. If an Nx port does not know about the FC IDs of other devices outside its zone,
   it cannot access those devices***
***

***Rebooting a Cisco MDS with 2 supervisors***
reload - will just reboot
system switchover - will lfailover to the other sv and reboot the current sv
sh module - log into the now active supervisor and look at modules 7 & 8 to make sure one says "active *"
            and the other says "ha-standby".
            Once you see that, you can reboot the now active supervisor by typing in:
            system switchover 
            You've now rebooted both supervisors.
NOTE: Be sure to save your running configuration to the startup configuration by typing in:
copy run start
***


***iSCSI***
MDS can map FC targets as iSCSI targets
MDS will map iSCSI initiators to FC virtual hosts
MDS by default will advertise all iSCSI targets on all Gb interfaces on all IPS and MPS-14/2 modules
MDS identifies iSCSI hosts by IQN(default) or by IP address(One virtual NPort per IP address), this is configured per IPS port
MDS presents iSCSI hosts to the FC fabric in transparent mode(one iSCSI host for one virtual FC host) or proxy(all iscsi for one virtual fc, only zoning as access control)
MDS assignment of WWN for iSCSI initiators, dynamic(default)(each iSCSI hosts might get a different WWN) or static(each iSCSI hosts gets a specific WWN) user or system assigned 
MDS can make a dynamic assigned nwwn/pwwn static
MDS can assign vsan membership per iSCSI host or per iSCSI MDS interface(all hosts connected to this interface will inherit the configured vsan except the explicitly configured in a vsan)
MDS provides two ways for access control for iSCSI devices, zoning and ACL, ACL has to be used for proxy initiator mode,
    for zoning can use wwn and ip address or IQN for iSCSI hosts that DONT have a static WWN.
    for ACL it only works if static iSCSI virtual targets exist. ACL can be enforced at the iSCSI discovery phase

Recommendation: 
      Use static mapping of iSCSI targets to pwwn (target)
      IQN for iSCSI initiator identification       (initiator)
      initiator mode with static system-assigned WWN's for the iSCSI to FC mapping (initiator)
      Per iSCSI host the VSAN membership for iSCSI hosts (initiator)
      zoning for access control (initiator and target)
 
1)Two ways to map FC targets as iSCSI targets(no default, must be configured):

Dynamic mapping: Automatic creation of iSCSI targets, it maps all FC targets as iSCSI devices
		 config t, iscsi import target fc
Static mapping: Manual creation of iSCSI targets, can map a target with all luns or a target with a specific lun(s)

		1)Map a whole FC target as an iSCSI virtual target, all luns are part of the target
		config t, iscsi virtual-target name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.target-1, pwwn 28:00:01:02:03:04:05:06
		
		2)Map a subset of luns of a FC target to three iSCSI virtual targets:
		config t, iscsi virtual-target name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.target-1, pWWN 28:00:01:02:03:04:05:06 fc-lun 0 iscsi-lun 0
         		  iscsi virtual-target name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.target-2, pWWN 28:00:01:02:03:04:05:06 fc-lun 1 iscsi-lun 0
          		  iscsi virtual-target name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.target-3, pWWN 28:00:01:02:03:04:05:06 fc-lun 2 iscsi-lun 0



2) iSCSI initiator identification configuration(How you want this IPS port to see iSCSI hosts, per IQN or IP address):

By IQN:
       config t, int iscsi 2/1, switchport initiator id name
By IP address:
       config t, int iscsi 2/1, switchport initiator id ip-address

3) How iSCSI hosts ares presented to the FC fabric(as many fc hosts or as one)

transparent mode:
 WWN assignment to iSCSI initiators:
   	
Dynamic: config t, iscsi dynamic initiator iscsi

Static using IQN name and system assigned: config t, iscsi initiator name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator, static nwwn system-assign, static pwwn system-assign
Static using IP address and system assigned: config t, iscsi initiator ip-address 10.1.1.2, static nwwn system-assign, static pwwn system-assign				
Static using IQN name and user assigned: config t, iscsi initiator name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator, static nwwn 20:00:00:05:30:00:59:11, static pwwn 21:00:00:20:37:73:3b:20
Static using IP address and user assigned: config t, iscsi initiator ip-address 10.1.1.2, static nwwn 20:00:00:05:30:00:59:11, static pwwn 21:00:00:20:37:73:3b:20  	         


change from dynamic to static assigned nwwn/pwwn:
	config t, iscsi save-initiator name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator - per IQN
	config t, iscsi save-initiator ip-address 10.1.1.2	- Per IP address
	config t, iscsi save-initiator	- saves the nwwn/pwwn that have automatically been assigned to all initiators

Proxy mode, with system-assigned nwww/pwwn or user defined:
System assigned: config t, int iscsi 2/1, switchport proxy-initiator
User assigned: config t, int iscsi 2/1, switchport proxy-initiator nwwn 20:00:00:05:30:00:59:11 pwwn 21:00:00:20:37:73:3b:20

VSAN membership for iSCSI devices:
	
	-Per iSCSI host: config t, iscsi initiator name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator, vsan 3
	-Per iSCSI interface: config t, iscsi interface vsan-membership, vsan database, vsan 2 interface iscsi 2/1

Access control:  
ZONING:
	zoning per iSCSI node name: config t, zone name iSCSIzone vsan 2, member symbolic-nodename iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator1
        zoning per IP address: member ip-address 10.1.1.2
        zoning per pwwn: member pwwn 20:00:00:05:30:00:59:11

iSCSI-based(for static iSCSI virtual targets only, is also the preferred option for proxy initiator mode):
  IQN based: config t, iscsi virtual-target name iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator, pWWN 26:00:01:02:03:04:05:06, initiator iqn.1987-02.com.cisco.initiator1 permit
  IP based:  initiator ipaddress 10.50.1.1 permit - Can also allow the entire subnet with "initiator ipaddress 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 permit"
        All: all-initiator-permit 	- Allows all initiator nodes to access this virutal target

config t, iscsi enable - Enable iSCSI
config t, int gig 2/1, no shut, int iscsi 2/1, no shut	-  Enabled both the Gig and iscsi interface
